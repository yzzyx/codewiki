codewiki - capable wiki-system with small memory footprint
==========================================================

0. WHY

Because most wiki's turned out to be resource hogs,
even though the core task is trivial. Requiring e.g.
mysql for a small wiki is insane. And the fact that
they're all interpreted means they have an overhead
of several megabytes even if they do nothing at all.

And because I suffer from a rampant case of NIH.

1. HOW

codewiki
First, setup your codewiki (configfile does not yet exist)

1.b fastcgi

If using fastcgi, this is for you.

Use spawn-fcgi. It's good for you.

Example::
	$ spawn-fcgi -p 8888 codewiki-fcgi

In lighttpd, the following config should do it
(if you have the fastcgi module enabled):

::
	server.modules += ( "mod_fastcgi" )
	server.modules += ( "mod_rewrite" )

	fastcgi.server += ( "/codewiki.fcgi" =>
			((
					"host" => "127.0.0.1",
					"port" => "8888",
					"check-local" => "disable",
					"broken-scriptfilename" => "enable",
			))
	)

	url.rewrite-once = ( "^(/wiki/.*)$" => "/codewiki.fcgi$1", )

If you want to use X-Sendfile (recommended), also add the following to
the fastcgi.server-section:

::
	"allow-x-send-file" => "enable"

and set 'use-xsendfile = 1' in codewiki.conf

codewiki by default sends any requests for static contents to /static.
This can be changed by setting 'static_url' in codewiki.conf.
Also, remember to copy the contents of the static-directory to this location.


That's the basic setup.

2. TODO
Lots. We're in alpha still.
